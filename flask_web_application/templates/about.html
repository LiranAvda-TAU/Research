    <h1> About Our Project </h1>
    <p> We aim to offer you tools that will help you be a more efficient researcher!</p>
    <p> We invite you to go ahead and try our orthologs tool (to find Caenorhabditis elegans\Human orthologs for your
    Human\Caenorhabditis elegans genes), our variants tool and our automated CRISPR planner</p>

    <p><b>Orthologs Finder Pipeline:</b></p>
    <p>A web interface that allow users to insert Human/Caenorhabditis elegans genes and get their Caenorhabditis
        elegans/Human orthologs and conservation information for given variants.</p>
    <p><u>How does it work?</u></p>
    <p>Out of the possible orthologs for your gene, extracted from the database of OrthoList2, the candidates are
        filtered by number of sources, ratio of the corresponding protein’s conserved domains, ratio of the protein’s size and
        validated by reversed BLAST.</p>
    <p>After finding the best Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog for your gene, the service will check whether this amino acid is
        conserved (and how conserved it is) and provide you with the corresponding site in the Caenorhabditis elegans
      gene sequence.</p>

    <div class="gap-10"></div>
    <p><b>Automated CRIPSR Planner:</b></p>
    <p>A service that will plan the CRISPR for your gene, given only the gene name, the mutated amino acid site and the
      current and desired amino acid.</p>
